1. **Project 1: Implementation of a Digital Controller on an Aerothermal System**  
   In this project, digital controllers (P, PI, PD, PID) were designed, implemented, and analyzed to regulate the airflow temperature of an aerothermal system. The performance of the control systems was evaluated by comparing Simulink simulations with real-world data.

2. **Project 2: Control of a Multivariable System (Three-Tank System)**  
   The three-tank system was modeled, linearized, and controlled using MATLAB and Simulink. Various system configurations were analyzed to examine the dynamics of multivariable control systems and their stability.

3. **Project 3: DC Motor Control and Performance Analysis of Different Control Methods**  
   The behavior of a DC motor was modeled using MATLAB/SIMULINK, and the performance of P, I, PI, PD, and PID controllers was analyzed. Different control strategies were applied to regulate the motor's angular velocity and current, evaluating system stability, response time, and error rates.

4. **Project 4: Real-Time Control of a DC Motor and PID Optimization**  
   Using a DAQ card within a MATLAB and Simulink environment, the speed of a DC motor was controlled, and its dynamic responses were analyzed with different controllers (P, PI, PID). Real-world data was compared with the model, demonstrating the superior performance of the PID controller.
